# Wireless-Network-with-Arduino-Project
This assignment is part of the course Applications of Telecommunications Systems(Auth 8th semester).The goal is to design and construct a centralised and distributed wireless sensor network which consists of four nodes.One node functions as the receiver while the other three nodes as transmitters.

Each wireless node consists of three parts: the sensors, the microcontroller and the transceiver. More specifically, the "brain" of the node is the Arduino Uno microcontroller board (based on the ATmega328 microcontroller). The wireless transceiver is the RFM22 shield that uses the re-programmable RFM22 module developed by "HOPERF". A small raster area is used for the needed sensors of the experiment. In addition, antennas are placed in each node.For the communication of wireless nodes the ALOHA protocol is used.Trasmitter one gets measurements from the sensors and the two other transmitters generate random numbers in the desired areas in order to simulate the real sensors measurements.

The sensors used are Pulse Sensor SEN-11574,Temperature and Humidity Sensor DHT11 and Rain Sensor.
